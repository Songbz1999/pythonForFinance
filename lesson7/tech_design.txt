8 steps

1. who are users
2. use cases
3. abstracted business flow (e.g. BPMN)
4. concreted tech solution -> tech stack for each flow node (POC, principle)
5. tech design details -> E-R diagram, class hierarchy
6. interface design
7. POC (demo) and coding (unit testing, refactor)
8. end to end testing (e.g. UAT)

Project - design simple trading research platform
1.  research ppl (R) -> strategy making
	business decision maker (B) -> UI for factors

2.  (1) (B) can see a list of strategy(portfolio)
	e.g. * simple all in -> 10 stcoks, 10% each 
	(2) select one portfolio, it can display all current equities and % in it
	e.g. * APPL 5%
		 * GOOG 5%
		 ...
		 total investment : 20,000
	(3) multiple financial index (past and current)
		performance factors and results
		risk factors
	(4) (nice to have) 
		-> compare two strategies
		-> able to change stock and %
	
	important:
	(5) (R) needs API for data, test (3) values, upload strategy,

	(6) strategy can refresh T-1 for trade days to pick/drop stocks and current stats.

3.	Python -> Flask -> pgsql / mongoDB  
	cache?
	messaging queue?
	distributed?
	external storage?
	cloud?
